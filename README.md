# Lan

**This is an intelligent programming language designed for deep learning based on LLVM and Julia.**

### Benchmarks
- IO
- MLP
- CNN
- RBM

### Goals
- Fastest programming language under Bechmarks
- Heterogenous programming: support both cpu and gpu

### Features
- Julia's front end to be easy for users to use
- CUDA C/C++'s heterogenous architecture support
- Use renforcement deep learning to produce highly optimized native code

### Dependency
- Julia
- LLVM

### Schedule
- [ ] A minimal version of Julia as Lan
- [ ] optimize Lan to overfit benchmarks
- [ ] add gpucc whether JIT or static compile to support NVIDIA GPU
