<p>Also, too many ideas came to my mind. Most of them has a good start and ended with an another. 
How to keep them live? Have them togother is my solution.</p>

<p>Plan to include DSA, Operating System, Compiler, Website Interface, Search Engine and Machine Learning.</p>

### Compiler: Gideon, an interactive artificial consciousness
- LLVM Project
